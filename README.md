# Lecture Slides and Materials

The lecture notes and materials are contained in each week's respective directory.

Each week we will provide:

- HTML slides laid out in a 2D grid by topic
- A PDF file of the slides for easy printing
- The raw source of the files in an R Markdown (.Rmd) file
- All of the R code executed to make the slides
