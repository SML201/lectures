# Lecture Slides and Materials

The lecture notes and materials are contained in each week's respective directory.

Each week we will provide:

- HTML slides laid out in a 2D grid by topic
- A PDF file of the slides for easy printing
- The raw source of the files in an R Markdown (.Rmd) file
- All of the R code executed to make the slides

To download any particular file:

- Click on the file name
- The contents of the file may be partially rendered in your web browser by GitHub
- To download the file, right click the "Raw" box and choose "Download Linked File"
- The file can then be found wherever your browser usually places downloaded files

To view the slides in HTML format:

- Download the week's html file (e.g., week1.html) as described above
- Double click the html file, which will open it in your web browser
- Press `esc` to see the 2D layout of the slides
    - The topics are along the top
    - The slides for each topic are below the main topic slide
- Click on any slide to leave the slide deck 2D overview
- To navigate the slides:
    - The left/right arrows move between topics
    - The up/down arrows move along slides within a topic
    - You can press the space bar to move linearly along the slides and avoid messing with the 2D layout
    - Pressing `Shift-Space` moves backwards in a linear fashion through the slides
- You can press the `F` key to enter full screen mode but this may not work well on all browsers
